# Quoridor
Hi,
this is a student project finished in spring 2023 recreating the boardgame Quoridor.
Quoridor is a two- or four-player intuitive strategy game designed by Mirko Marchesi and published by Gigamic Games.

So far only the two-player game is implemented!!!

The white/first player (top) owns the walls on the left, the yellow/second player (bottom) owns the walls on the right.
To move the piece click on it and the possible moves will be highlighted. By clicking on one of the highlighted tiles one does finalises the chosen move.
If one instead want to place a wall, click on the wall that belongs to the corresponding player (s. above).
The possible places where one can putt a wall are highlighted. To rotate the wall by 90 degrees right click.
To go back from wall placement to piece movement click on the corresponding play piece.

The play piece that reaches the starting line of the opponent first wins.

For more detailed rules to Quoridor follow the linked to the Wikipedia-page provided above.

Have fun!!
